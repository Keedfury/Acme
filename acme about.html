          <p>
            Bob and Sheila, owner-operators of Paradise Connections Yacht Charters, are experienced
            sailors whose goal is to assist you in finding the best boat for your charter yacht
            sailing vacation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bob grew up around boats in Southern California, while Sheila's only boating experience
            was riding a ferry a couple of times. We met, got married and went to France in 1980. We
            lived on a péniche (French barge) for a few years on the Seine river outside of Paris.
            This is where we got the boat-building bug.
          </p>
          <p>
            After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a large project -- a
            26-foot liveaboard sailboat. Within six months we were living aboard Loose Moose on the
            Marne river east of Paris.

            <p>
              Jude is such a cool 6'2 boy fr. But he needs to lock-in he has great potential  and is lowk wasting his time.
              The crew of Paradise Connections live in the Caribbean islands year round aboard our
              personal sail boat. We keep in touch with the boats and crews as they are our friends
              and neighbors
